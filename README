abaaso

abaaso provides a set of classes and object prototyping to ease the creation and maintenance of RESTful JavaScript applications.
HATEOAS can be implemented by setting abaaso.state.header which will trigger a transition (state change) if the header is part of an xhr response.
This requires standby listeners to be created on "ready" so the observer can replace the active listeners; otherwise an exception is thrown.

See #link for the development roadmap.
