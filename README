abaaso

abaaso provides a set of classes and object prototyping to ease the creation and maintenance of RESTful
JavaScript applications. HATEOAS can be implemented by setting abaaso.state.header which will trigger a
transition (state change) if the header is part of an xhr response. This requires standby listeners to
be created on "ready" so the observer can replace the active listeners; otherwise an exception is thrown.
