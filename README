aFrame

"An A-frame is a basic structure designed to bear a load in a lightweight economical manner."

aFrame provides a set of classes and object prototyping to ease the creation and maintenance of RESTful JavaScript applications.
HATEOAS can be implemented by setting aFrame.state.header which will trigger a transition (state change) if the header is part of an xhr response.
This requires standby listeners to be created on "ready" so the observer can replace the active listeners; otherwise an exception is thrown.
