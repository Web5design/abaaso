# abaaso

abaaso is a modern, lightweight Enterprise class RESTful JavaScript application framework.

[![build status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/avoidwork/abaaso.png)](http://travis-ci.org/avoidwork/abaaso)

## How is it different?

abaaso gets in front of APIs with `DataStores`, providing a really powerful model which can be displayed with reactive DOM components: `DataLists` & `DataGrids`. It complements UI frameworks by handling the I/O, as well as filtering & sorting the data.

abaaso foregoes MVC in favor of the native OOP design of JavaScript with custom instances, allowing for a clean separation of concerns.
